        <p>Bilbo Baggins is the protagonist and one of the most respectable characters from one J.R.R. Tolkien's famous novel, The Hobbit. Baggins is one of a race of creatures about half the size of humans, known as a Hobbit. Like most Hobbits, Bilbo loves simple food in abundance, his pipe, and staying in a well-furnished hobbit-hole. Until one day, his encounter and adventures with a wizard and thirteen dwarves changed his life forever. </p>
